<div class="content1"><h2>About Mrs. A</h2></div>


<div class="centeronly" style="height:300px; width:200px;"><img src="picme.jpg" height="300px" width="200px"/></div>
<div class="content2 centeronly"><p>My name is Kristin Alarcon, and I have been cheering and dancing for over 18 years. I have been involved in cheer and dance as a participant, 
teacher, coach, and judge. Most recently, I serve as the Director of Media and Tabulation for Judges' Affiliation of the Oregon Dance and Drill Coaches' Association. 
For two sesons, I was a member of the South Sound Nightingales, a semi-pro cheer team for the South Sound Nighthawks football team.
While living in Federal Way, I coached the varsity cheer team at Federal Way High School (where I was also the business teacher), and prior to that I coached the Eastmont High School dance team for three seasons.
I have taught courses in hip-hop, jazz, tap, and contemporary for various dance studios in Oregon and Washington for several years. While attending the University of Oregon in 2004-2008, I served as the 
choreographer and captain of the UO Hip-Hop team, the Jam Squad.  At Clackamas High School (Portland, OR), I was a member 
of the highly competitive varsity dance team for four years, and served as a captain my senior year as well as taking first place 
at the state drill down competition.</p></div>

<div class="content1 clearfloat"><h2>So Why Bows?</h2></div>
<div class="content3">
<p>I have to admit, I sort of stumbled into this whole deal. I've been teaching Business for several years, and this year I started teaching Web Design at the high school 
level. I was brainstorming theoretical business ideas I could use as an example for the final business-web page project, and decided that I could pretend I sold the cheer 
bows I make for myself and my various teams. After putting together the example site, I showed it to my students and team members, and the amount of positive feedback was 
overwhelming! I'd always gotten compliments on the bows when I wear them, but putting the site together took the exposure to a whole other level. I decided to take my hobby 
and turn it into something totally worthwhile!</p>
<p>Each bow is hand made to order - you can specify the size, colors, theme, and degree of decoration. Each bow is priced according to the cost of materials and time needed 
to produce the bow. See the pricing page for more info</p></div>
