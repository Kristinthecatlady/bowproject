Their prices are higher than average and they charge almost as much for shipping as they do for each bow. They do not customize bows, and you must order a minimum of 5 at a time.</td></tr>

<div class="blackbox1 centeronly" style="width:1000px;"><h3 style="font-size:40px; text-align:center; color:#FF00FF;">Competitive Advantage</h3><p style="font-size:16px;">Here at Mrs. A's, we believe that consumers will purchase from us
rather than (or in addition to) our competitors because we are a local, non-profit business. Our target market has been raised with a mindset that buying local
is the best, most socially conscious thing to do when one must buy things, so we appeal to that attitude where larger companies like Varsity and OmniCheer do not. 
We also offer low to average pricing as well as custom service; none of our identified competitiors can boast both. Once a clientele has been established, we will
also be able to keep costs low by relying on word-of-mouth recommendations and social media presences for advertising. Since we are a non-profit and all proceeds 
go to a local charity, we are able to offer the best possible service without factoring in the profit margins or filling the pockets of shareholders. Because this
business is a cherished hobby rather than a means of earning a living wage, our customers know that they will get a product that both creator and wearer can be 
proud of, and not just something slapped together as cheaply as possible in order to drive profits. Bottom line: I like making bows. I want to keep making bows. 
In order to keep making bows, I have to produce something that meets all the needs of my clients. I do just that by creating high-quality, affordable bows. Everybody wins!</p></div>
